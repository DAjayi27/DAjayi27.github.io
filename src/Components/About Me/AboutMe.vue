            <p> Hello! My name is Darasimi Ajayi, and Iâ€™m a second-year Computer Science student at Dalhousie University. 
                I have a passion for technology and love exploring different areas of computing. 
                Systems programming holds a special interest for me, as I enjoy diving deep into its complexities.
                Outside of academics, I spend my free time playing games, listening to music, and am a life long Real Madrid fan. 
                Always exited for a new challenge not matter how difficult, and always ready to learn ðŸ˜Š.
